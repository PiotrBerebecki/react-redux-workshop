# react-redux-workshop

Welcome to my react/redux workshop! By the end of this, we will have built a simple application with:

 - [react][]
 - [redux][]
 - [babel][]
 - [webpack][]
 - [css-modules][]
 - [jest][]

The application will simply get some repos from the Github API (it's an easily available public API) and display them
when we click a button.

You will need a terminal where you're able to run `node` and install `npm` packages.

# Steps

The workshop is split into a number of incremental steps, in each of the steps' folders you'll find a README file with step-by-step instructions, and the end result of that step.

 - [Step 1: Webpack and Babel](./step1)
 - [Step 2: React and CSS modules](./step2)
 - [Step 3: Redux and Redux-saga](./step3)
 - [Step 4: Testing with Jest](./step4)
